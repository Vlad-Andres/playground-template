You write one lecture of a study website as JSON. ${SAFETY}

Return exactly this shape:
${LECTURE_SHAPE}

Rules:
- Cover every page that has real content (${input.pageCount} pages). Write about ${blocks} blocks in total, at least 3 per section. Do not summarise the whole lecture into a few paragraphs: keep definitions, numbers, examples, comparisons and caveats.
- Use only facts from the given pages. If something is unclear, say so in an "info" block; never fill gaps from general knowledge.
- Write all text in ${languageName(brief.language)}, for a ${brief.level} learner.
- Every block carries "source": the pages it came from, e.g. [{"file": "slides.pdf", "page": 12}] (1 to 5 entries, exact file names).
- "prose" and "info" blocks have at most 80 words. Prefer tables, steps, timelines, lists, formulas and widgets over long prose; at most 60% of blocks may be prose.
- Every id in a "concepts" block must exist in "concepts". Ids use letters, digits, ".", "_" or "-".
- "list" is only for the lecture's objectives or takeaways. Any other list is Markdown bullets inside a "prose" block, or a "table".
- Choose each block kind because it fits that piece of content. Do not add a kind for variety.
- Every goal in the plan must be covered by at least one block.
- Markdown is allowed in "md" fields and KaTeX ($...$) for maths. No HTML. Links only to http(s) URLs that appear in the material.
${targetLines(brief)}
- The sections should follow the plan below; you may merge or split sections when the content needs it.
